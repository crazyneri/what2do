add with:

npm add react-beautiful-dnd

There are three components

1. DragDropContext

-   This is the wrapper for everything

2. Droppable

-   These are regions that you can drag things into

3. Draggable

-   These are components that can be dragged into 'Droppable' regions

The above components need importing from 'react-beautiful-dnd':
import { DragDropContext, Droppable, Draggable} from 'react-beautiful-dnd';

the DragDropContext component has 3 callbacks:
onDragStart -> called at the beginning of a drag
onDragUpdate -> called when something changes
onDragEnd -> called at the end of a drag

\*onDragEnd is the only required callback -> it's job is to synchronously update
the state with the result of the drag/drop

---

The on onDragEnd 'result' looks like this:

const result = {
draggableId: 'task-1', <- this is the item's identifier
type: 'TYPE',
reason: 'DROP', <- either DROP or CANCEL(?) - not typically important
source: { <- the start point
droppableId: 'coloumn-1', <- started in column-1...
index: 0, <- ...in position 0  
 },
destination: { <- the end point <- this can be null e.g. if the item is dropped outside of a list
droppableId: 'column-1', <- finished in column-1...
index: 1, <- ...in position 1
},
};

---

styling

!! can change anything apart from the size of the components during a drag !!

const draggableSnapshot {
isDragging: true,
draggingOver: 'column-1',
};

const droppableSnapshot {
isDraggingOver: true,
draggingOverWith: 'task-1',
}
